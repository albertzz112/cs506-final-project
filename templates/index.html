    <h1>Flight Delay Prediction Model</h1>

    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
    <p>
      This project focuses on predicting flight delays using Boosting as our
      machine learning model, specifically from the CatBoost Regressor library.
      The model leverages historical flight data, incorporating categorical
      features such as airline, origin, and destination, to provide accurate
      delay predictions. This can help airlines, airports, and passengers better
      manage schedules, optimize resources, and enhance customer satisfaction.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Description</h3>
    <p>
      The dataset comes from the US Department of Transportation â€“ Bureau of
      Transportation Statistics (August 2019 - August 2023). It contains flight
      data from major U.S. airports, with the key variable being arrival delay
      (ARR_DELAY), which measures the difference in minutes between the
      scheduled and actual arrival times. The dataset was cleaned and processed
      to focus on flights from the 30 largest U.S. airports, excluding canceled
      flights, and data from 2022-23 to to avoid the model cheating (learning
      useless shortcuts).
    </p>

    <h3>Data Acquisition, Processing, and Cleaning</h3>
    <p>
      The dataset was filtered to include only flights from the 30 largest U.S.
      airports by passenger traffic. We also removed canceled flights and
      filtered out data from 2020 to avoid model bias. Additional features were
      derived, such as month and day indicators, and route-specific delay
      probabilities. Irrelevant features were dropped, and missing values were
      handled to maintain dataset integrity. Irrelevant features or those that
      would allow the model to cheat were dropped.

    </script>

    <h3>Data Science Process</h3>
    <p>
      The project followed a typical data science pipeline, involving data
      acquisition, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. Challenges during
      data processing included leakage identification which was done using a
      correlation heatmap of different variables to allow for a visualization of
      which variables might allow for the model to cheat. Different
      visualizations of the data were used to help decide which features can be
      engineered or used for the model, including representations of flight
      delay distributions, average delay by month, average delays by airline,
      and average delay by origin and destination. These allowed us to engineer
      useful features such as a route delay indicator and month delay indicator
      that can give the model useful information on how a month or route might
      typically affect delays based on historical trends. When building the
      model, many libraries were unable to handle categorical variables, which
      was solved by using the CatBoost library which can handle categorical
      variables natively. Finally, the model uses a 80/20 train test split, with
      the parameters of the model having 1000 iterations, 0.1 learning rate, and
      max tree depth of 6. This is typical of a boosting algorithm since
      boosting relies on building small but specialized decision trees and
      aggregating their results by crunching the guesses and adding it to the
      model. Overall, this approach proved effective by resulting in a lower MSE
      than when using Random Forest.
